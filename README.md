# Interpretable-machine-learning-for-credit-risk-modelling-using-SHAP-and-LIME
Interpretable machine learning for credit risk modelling using SHAP and LIME involves employing cutting-edge techniques to explain predictions made by complex black-box models [1]. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) provide human-understandable justifications
